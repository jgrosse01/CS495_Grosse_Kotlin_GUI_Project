# CS495_Grosse_Kotlin_GUI_Project

This is a complete project for the Carroll College Computer Science Seminar: Kotlin GUI Project.

The minimum requirement for this project is to utilize Java Swing in Kotlin to print "Hello World" to the screen.

For this project, I developed a password generator application. I tought myself gradle as well as Kotlin's TornadoFX and by extension some JavaFX. For those reasons this project far exceeds the minimum requirements.

The code included is functional and runs while accounting for input validation as there are no free-input fields included; therefore, there cannot be invalid inputs.


In order to run the program, clone the repository, and, in a terminal window, navigate to the top layer of the repository folder on your computer. Then run the following command (without quotation marks):

"./gradlew run"
